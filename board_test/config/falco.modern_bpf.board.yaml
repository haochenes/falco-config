# Board: use modern eBPF driver (Falco 0.32+ recommended).
# No .ko needed; requires Falco built with BUILD_MODERN_BPF=ON and kernel with BTF (typically 5.8+).
# Use this when your cross_compile has modern-bpf support; deploy script can select it when BUILD_MODERN_BPF was ON.
load_plugins: []  # or keep container if libcontainer.so (aarch64) is deployed
