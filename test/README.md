## Execution Workflow

### 1. Prepare Environment

```bash
# In project root directory
./scripts/setup_docker.sh

# Enter container (runs as tester user)
docker exec -it falco-test-ubuntu bash

# Install Falco (if not yet installed, requires sudo)
sudo /tmp/install_falco.sh
```

### 2. Start Falco

In container, choose one of the following methods to start Falco:

**Method 1: Using default configuration (recommended for testing)**
```bash
sudo falco -c /etc/falco/falco.yaml &
```

**Method 2: Using specified configuration file**
```bash
sudo falco -c /etc/falco/falco.yaml
```

**Method 3: Background run and output to file**
```bash
sudo falco -c /etc/falco/falco.yaml > /var/log/falco.log 2>&1 &
tail -f /var/log/falco.log
```

**Method 4: Test configuration (dry-run, only validate configuration)**
```bash
sudo falco --dry-run -c /etc/falco/falco.yaml
```

### 3. Run Test Cases

In another terminal, enter container and execute test script:

```bash
docker exec -it falco-test-ubuntu bash
cd /opt/falco-test
bash cases/case1_sensitive_file_opening.sh
```

### 4. View Falco Logs

**If Falco is running in foreground**: View output directly in terminal

**If Falco is running in background**: 
```bash
tail -f /var/log/falco.log
```

**View system logs**:
```bash
sudo journalctl -u falco -f  # If using systemd
```

### 5. Analyze Results

Compare actual output with expected results in `expected_outputs/` directory.

## Expected Log Format

Example of Falco standard log format:

```
2024-12-15T10:22:33.812791015+0000: Warning Sensitive file opened for reading by non-trusted program (file=/etc/shadow gparent=sudo ggparent=bash gggparent=tmux: evt_type=openat user=tester user_uid=1000 user_loginuid=1000 process=cat proc_exepath=/usr/bin/cat parent=sudo command=cat /etc/shadow terminal=34826 container_id=host container_name=host)
```

**Field Description**:
- **Timestamp**: ISO 8601 format
- **Priority**: Warning, Critical, Error, etc.
- **Rule Name**: Triggered Falco rule name
- **Event Details**: 
  - `file`: Accessed file path
  - `process`: Process name
  - `user`: Executing user
  - `evt_type`: Event type (openat, execve, etc.)
  - `command`: Full executed command
  - `container_id/container_name`: Container information (if in container environment)

## Troubleshooting

### Falco Cannot Start

1. Check if driver is correctly installed:
   ```bash
   sudo falco --list-syscall-events
   ```

2. Check permissions:
   ```bash
   # Ensure container has sufficient permissions
   docker exec -it falco-test-ubuntu ls -la /sys/kernel/debug
   ```

3. View detailed errors:
   ```bash
   sudo falco -v
   ```

### No Expected Events Detected

1. Check if rules are enabled:
   ```bash
   sudo falco -L  # List all rules
   ```

2. Validate rule syntax:
   ```bash
   sudo falco -c /etc/falco/falco.yaml -r /etc/falco/falco_rules.yaml --dry-run
   ```

3. Increase log verbosity:
   ```bash
   sudo falco -v -c /etc/falco/falco.yaml
   ```

## Testing Notes

**Important**: Not all test cases will trigger Falco's default rules. Falco's default rules primarily focus on:
- ✅ Sensitive file access (e.g., `/etc/shadow`)
- ✅ System directory writes (e.g., `/etc`)
- ✅ Network connections

Some behaviors (file permission modifications, process injection, etc.) may require custom rules to detect.

See [TESTING_NOTES.md](TESTING_NOTES.md) for detailed information about:
- Which test cases are most likely to succeed
- How to add custom rules for better detection
- Tips for improving test results

## System-Level IDPS Test Scripts (R155 Aligned)

Test scripts aligned with **System-Level IDPS Detection Test Cases For Embedded Linux v1.1** are in `test/idps/`:

- **30 test scripts** matching document case IDs (SYS-PROC-001, SYS-FILE-001, etc.)
- **TEST_METHODS.md** – detailed test method steps for each case
- **README.md** – mapping and usage

```bash
cd /opt/falco-test
bash idps/SYS-PROC-001.sh   # Example: unexpected uid/gid
bash idps/SYS-FILE-001.sh   # Example: writes to /etc
# Run all: for f in idps/SYS-*.sh; do bash "$f"; done
```
